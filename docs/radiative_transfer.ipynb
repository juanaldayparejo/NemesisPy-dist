    "The NEMESIS code is able to model the electromagnetic spectrum of different planetary atmospheres under different observing geometries (e.g., nadir-viewing, limb-viewing, solar occultations, exoplanet phase curves, etc.). In order to generate the spectra, NEMESIS reads the required information from input files, performs the calculations, and writes the outputs into other files. The structure of NemesisPy, shown in the Figure below, is equivalent to that of NEMESIS: 1) The information from the input files is stored into classes, which are later carried through the code. 2) The reference classes, together with the specific model parameterisations that want to be tested, feed the required information into the Forward Model class, which is in charge of performing the radiative transfer calculations and modelling the spectra. 3) The modelled spectra are then written into output files.\n",

    "In order to model the atmosphere of different planets, NEMESIS uses an ID number for each of these, and searches some important parameters (e.g., size and mass) to compute the gravitational field at different altitudes and latitudes. Currently, the planets whose IDs have been implemented in the code are:\n",

This particular file can be read/write using the *read_ref()* and *write_ref()* functions in the Atmosphere class (see Examples). The units of the file are: Altitude (km), Pressure (atm), Temperature (K) and volume mixing ratio (dimensionless). Note that the units of these parameters once the file has been read are different (altitude in m and pressure in Pa), but the read/write functions take this unit conversion automatically into account.\n",

    "\n",
    "- LATITUDE: The latitude of the profile must be defined to accurately calculate the gravitational field.\n",
    "- AMFORM: This parameter indicates how the molecular weight of the atmosphere must be calculated. If AMFORM=0, then the molecular weight is assumed to be constant for all altitude levels and must be specified in the *.ref* file. If AMFORM=1, then the molecular weight is calculated internally and independently for each altitude level after the VMRs have been scaled to $\\sum_i{\\mathrm{VMR}_i} = 1$. If AMFORM=2, then the molecular weight is calculated internally and independently for each altitude level but without scaling the molecular abundances. \n",

    "### Aerosols\n",

    "Apart from the gaseous species, the atmosphere is also represented by a set of aerosol vertical profiles. These aerosol profiles must be accompanied by a set of optical properties, defined in the Scatter class. Therefore, each of the aerosol populations does not necessarily represent aerosols of different nature (e.g., mineral dust and clouds), but might represent the same aerosol composition with different optical properties (e.g., two different particle size distributions of the same aerosol species).\n",

This particular file can be read/write using the *read_aerosol()* and *write_aerosol()* functions in the Atmosphere class (see Examples). The units of the aerosol vertical profiles in the *aerosol.ref* are m$^{-2}$. Note that this is different from the unit of the file in NEMESIS, which are defined in number of particles per gram of atmosphere.\n",

The tables must be written with a specified format and must have a *.kta* extension. In addition, the ILBL parameter in the *.inp* file must be set to ILBL = 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "At this stage, NemesisPy does not include routines to calculate the cross sections from line databases. These must be calculated using the programs from the Fortran version of NEMESIS. However, NemesisPy includes a set of routines in the Spectroscopy class to read these tables (see Examples). It must be noted that the cross sections stored in the pre-tabulated tables are multiplied by a factor of 10$^{20}$, and must be corrected by the user to get the correct values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the user might want to use other sources for the cross sections other than from line databases (e.g., UV cross section data). In that case, NemesisPy includes a set of routines to write the pre-tabulated tables in the specified format (see Examples).\n",

    "## Surface\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether the surface class for a given retrieval must be included depends on the planet. When the Planet ID is read by NEMESIS, it will activate a flag indicating whether the planet has a surface or not. In the case the planet has a surface, then NEMESIS will read the information from the *.sur* file. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *.sur* file includes the information of the spectral surface emissivity $\\epsilon(\\lambda)$, and can be read with the Surface class using the *read_sur()* function. If the ground albedo specified in the *.set* file is a negative number, then the albedo at each wavelength is calculated using $a(\\lambda) = 1 - \\epsilon(\\lambda)$.\n",

This is especially important for retrievals, when these parameters are modified in each iteration to find the best fit between the modelled and measured spectra.

    "## Adding custom model parameterisations\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible that the users may want to define their own custom parameterisations, to create new retrieval schemes for the specific purposes. In order to do so, one must implement the following steps:\n",
