    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The NEMESIS code is able to model the electromagnetic spectrum of different planetary atmospheres under different observing geometries (e.g., nadir-viewing, limb-viewing, solar occultations, exoplanet phase curves, etc.). In order to generate the spectra, NEMESIS reads the required information from input files, performs the calculations, and writes the outputs into other files. The structure of NemesisPy, shown in the Figure below, is equivalent to that of NEMESIS: 1) The information from the input files is stored into classes, which are later carried through the code. 2) The reference classes, together with the specific model parameterisations that want to be tested, feed the required information into the Forward Model class, which is in charge of performing the radiative transfer calculations and modelling the spectra. 3) The modelled spectra are then written into output files.\n",

However, a observed spectrum typically represents the convolution of the high-resolution spectrum with the instrumental lineshape. In NEMESIS, the instrument lineshape is defined using the using the full-width at half maximum (*FWHM*) in the Measurement class. There are three options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If *FWHM=0*, then NEMESIS will not convolve the modelled spectrum with any instrumental function, as this is assumed to be directly performed in the calculation of the *k*-coefficients (in the case of a correlated-*k* calculation).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If *FWHM>0*, then NEMESIS will convolve the spectrum with a constant instrument line shape throughout the modelled spectral range. The shape of the instrumental function is indicated in the *.sha* file, using a single integer, following:\n",
    "\n",
    "| ID | Line shape |\n",

    "| 4 | Hanning function |\n",
    "\n",
    "- If *FWHM<0*, then NEMESIS will convolve the modelled spectrum with a varying instrumental lineshape. This function is defined in the *.fil* file. For each convolution wavelength (*VCONV*), then the instrument function is defined independently by defining a finer grid of wavelengths (*VFIL*) with the corresponding values of the filter function (*AFIL*). The *.fil* can be easily read/write using the *read_fil()* and *write_fil()* functions of the Measurement class.\n",

    "NEMESIS can perform the radiative transfer calculations both in wavelength and wavenumber space. This is indicated through the *ISPACE* flag defined in the *.inp* file, where *ISPACE* = 0 indicates wavenumber space in cm$^{-1}$, and *ISPACE* = 1 indicated wavelength space in $\\mu$m.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, one can also define several types of spectrum. This is defined through the *IFORM* flag, which can take several values following:\n",

    "In the forward model, the vertical profiles defined in the Atmosphere class are re-shaped into atmospheric layers in which the radiative transfer calculations are performed. Each of these atmospheric layers will have its own properties (e.g., pressure, temperature, vertical column density, etc.), providing a realistic representation of the atmosphere along the measurement path. Ideally, the atmosphere would be split into an infinite number of layers, although such approach is not possible in radiative transfer models. Instead, NEMESIS allows to divide the atmosphere into *NLAY* layers, which can be split different approaches to mitigate any biases arising from the finite representation of the atmospheric layers. These approaches, which are defined using the *LAYTYP* field of the Layer class, include:\n",

    "\n",
    "The model parameterisations have the purpose of modifying the information in the reference classes according to a smaller number of parameters. This is especially important for retrievals, when these parameters are modified in each iteration to find the best fit between the modelled and measured spectra. Each of the model parameterisations is defined by some Variable IDs and Variable parameters, which are defined in the *.apr* file. This file can be read using the *read_apr* function on the Variables class. \n",

    "## Adding custom model parameterisations\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible that the users may want to define their own custom parameterisations, to create new retrieval schemes for the specific purposes. In order to do so, one must implement the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select one model parameterisation ID number, considering the numbers already taken by others.\n",
    "2. Open the file for the class *Variables_0.py*, and change the function *read_apr()* to tell NemesisPy how to read this parameterisation from the *.apr* file. In this function, different fields must be properly filled:\n",
    "   - Variables.VARIDENT : This field represents the Variable IDs, unique for this model parameterisation.\n",
    "   - Variables.VARPARAM : This field represents any extra parameters the code needs to read to properly represent the parameterisation, but that will not be retrieved (i.e., they are not included in the state vector).\n",
    "   - Variables.XA : This field represents the state vector and must be filled accordingly based on the parameters stored on the *.apr* file.\n",
    "   - Variables.SA : This field represents the a priori covariance matrix and must be filled accordingly based on the parameters stored on the *.apr* file.\n",
    "   - Variables.LX : This field tells whether a particular element of the state vector is carried in log-scale.\n",
    "   - Variables.NUM : This field tells whether the jacobian matrix for this particular element of the state vector can be computed analytically (0) or numerically (1).\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Open the file for the class *Variables_0.py*, and change the function *calc_NXVAR()* to tell NemesisPy the number of parameters in the state vector associated with this particular model parameterisation.\n",
    "4. Open the file *subprofretg.py*, which maps the variables of the state vector to the different classes included in the forward model (e.g., Atmosphere, Surface...), as well as the gradients in the case that these are calculated analytically.\n",
