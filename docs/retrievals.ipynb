    "In order to obtain information about the structure and composition of a planetary atmosphere from its electromagnetic spectrum, apart from the radiative transfer model, which relates the atmospheric parameters to the modelled spectrum, we need a retrieval tool to solve the inverse problem, which allows us to estimate what atmospheric parameters provide a best fit between the modelled and measured spectrum. There are several codes and techniques that can be applied to solve the inverse problem, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. In NEMESIS, two different retrieval methodologies can be applied: Optimal Estimation and Nested Sampling. "

However, for planetary atmospheres no such statistical record exists, and in that case the diagonal elements of the *a priori* covariance matrix are set to the square of the estimated errors in the *a priori* state vector. In the case of retrieving continuous vertical profiles, the values at different altitudes are assumed to be correlated, and the off-diagonal terms of $\\mathbf{S}_a$ are then set to follow\n",

Instead, NEMESIS uses a scheme based on the Marquardtâ€“Levenberg principal, in which the state vector at the next iteration is modified so that it follows\n",

In such a case, the retrieval can be regarded as an estimate of the smoothed state rather than an estimate of the true state, or what is equivalent, an estimate of the true state, but with an error contribution due to smoothing. This contribution to the retrieved error can be calculated as:\n",

    "There are several parameters that need to be specified to run an Optimal Estimation retrieval:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The *.apr* file includes the information about the *a priori* state vector $\\mathbf{x}_a$ and the uncertainties in the state vector prior to the retrieval $\\mathbf{S}_a$. The way in which the retrieval parameters and their uncertainties are specified depend on the model. A complete guide of the format for the different models is provided in the NEMESIS manual, and examples for the models included in NemesisPy are given in the Examples section of this website. Currently, there is no internal function in NemesisPy to write the *.apr* file, but it can be easily read using the *read_apr()* function of the Variables class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The maximum number of iterations (NITER) is specified in the *.inp* file. If NITER is set to -1, then the program will only run a forward model using the model parameterisations in the *.apr* file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The retrieval stops if a convergence criterion is satisfied: the reduction of the cost function $\\phi$ is lower than a given factor (PHILIMIT). This factor is also specified in the *.inp* file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the retrieval is finished, there are two outputs files that are generated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The *.mre* file includes the information about the best fit and the retrieved parameters. This file can be read using the *read_mre()* function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The *.cov* file includes information about the matrices relevant for the Optimal Estimation retrieval, such as the Jacobian matrix, averaging kernels, error covariance matrices, etc. This file can be read using the *read_cov()* function of the Optimal Estimation class."
