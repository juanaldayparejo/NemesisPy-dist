The NEMESIS planetary atmosphere radiative transfer and retrieval tool
======================================================================

This website includes the documentation regarding the Python version of the NEMESIS (Non-linear Optimal Estimator for MultivariatE
Spectral analySIS) code. 

The main description of the NEMESIS code was published by `Irwin et al. (2008) <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.2007.11.006>`_.
The original Fortran version of the code is `available here <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4303976>`_.

In this website, we aim to provide a more practical description of the code, including retrieval examples applied to different observing geometries or physical parameterisations.

**NOTE:** At this stage, documentation is under development.

Install NemesisPy
------------------

The latest version of code has to be downloaded from `Github <https://github.com/juanaldayparejo/NemesisPy-dist.git>`_.

In the future, we aim to release official versions to The Python Package Index (PyPI), so that it can be installed using pip.
