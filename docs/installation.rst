Install NemesisPy
------------------

The latest version of code has to be downloaded from `Github <https://github.com/juanaldayparejo/NemesisPy-dist.git>`_.

Once the code has been downloaded from Github, move the NemesisPy-dist/ package to a desired path. Then, inside the package, type ::

$ pip install --editable .

This will install the NemesisPy package, but with the ability to update any changes made to the code (e.g., when introducing new model parameterisations).

In the future, we aim to release official versions to The Python Package Index (PyPI), so that it can be directly installed using pip.
